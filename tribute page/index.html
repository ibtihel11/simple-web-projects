                Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist widely recognized for his development of the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. 
                He is most famous for his equation E=mc², which describes the relationship between mass and energy.

            <div id="rest-content">
                <ul>
                    <li>1879 - Albert Einstein is born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire. </li>
                    <li>1880 to 1894 - Einstein grows up in Munich, where his family moves shortly after his birth. His early education shows a strong aptitude for mathematics and physics.</li>
                    <li>1894 - Einstein's family moves to Milan, Italy, due to financial problems with Hermann's business.</li>
                    <li>1895 to 1900 - After failing the entrance exam to the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, Einstein spends a year at a preparatory school in Aarau, Switzerland. He graduates in 1900 with a degree in teaching mathematics and physics.</li>
                    <li>1901 - He becomes a Swiss citizen and begins working as a technical assistant at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.</li>
                    <li>1905 - Often called his "Annus Mirabilis" (miracle year), Einstein publishes four groundbreaking papers in the Annalen der Physik journal:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The photoelectric effect.</li>
                            <li>The special theory of relativity.</li>
                            <li>The idea of Brownian motion.</li>
                            <li>The equivalence of mass and energy.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>1909 - After earning his Ph.D. from the University of Zurich, Einstein becomes a professor at the University of Zurich.</li>
                    <li>1911 - Einstein takes a position at the German University in Prague, where he works on the theory of relativity.</li>
                    <li>1915 - General Theory of Relativity: Einstein completes his theory of general relativity, which proposes that gravity is a result of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass.</li>
                    <li>1921 - Einstein wins the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the photoelectric effect, not for his theory of relativity as commonly assumed.</li>
                    <li>1955 - Albert Einstein passes away in Princeton, New Jersey, at the age of 76 from an abdominal aneurysm. His brain is later removed for scientific study.</li>
                </ul>
