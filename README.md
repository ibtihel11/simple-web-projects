# simple-web-projects

This repository contains a collection of small responsive web design projects completed as part of my learning journey through FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification.

These projects showcase the gradual progress I made while practicing HTML, CSS, and web layout techniques.  
They are not production-ready applications but demonstrate my growing understanding of web development concepts.

## Projects Included:
- Tribute Page  
- Technical Documentation Page  
- Survey Form  

## Note:
These projects were built progressively during the learning process to apply new concepts and improve over time.
